## Installation

## Extras

While koa-starter isn't a framework, I've added a few small extras to make getting your project up and started as easy as possible.

#### Error Handling

Thrown errors are caught in the error handling middleware in `errorHandler.js`.

#### Webpack Config

For build using webpack.

#### Code Linting and Formatting

Using prettier and eslint for code lint and formatting.

#### Logging

Using cabin for logging services.
